# ai-bayesian_data-synthesis
The necessity of synthetic data sets stems from the need for data analysis and
processing coupled with the need for privacy and security. Without security, the
publicâ€™s private information is at risk. Additionally, the synthesizing and
randomizing of data, but without statistically accurate data, can lead to the
inability to preform proper data analysis. Through a number of measures, we
explore and evaluate the utility and risk of such a method of synthesizing data
through the Dirichlet Process Mixture of Products of Multinomial distributions
model on a patient characteristics survey.
